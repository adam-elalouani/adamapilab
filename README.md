CPU & GPU API
My idea is to make an api that will help a user choose a cpu and gpu based on their needs. Whether it's price or certain specs necessary for the user.

1. My project will help create choose the right cpu and gpu based on its age, price, and specs. I may also add a part of the website where it finds the best pairs of cpu and gpu to match a user’s need. 
What are your motivations for this idea?
2. I used to build PCs for customers as a business and this database/ API would have really helped with selecting parts to build up the pc. I would be able to maximize profits while providing my customers with excellent PCs. 
3. I would also like to “create an account” section to my website as my website is not only just for cpu and gpu information but can also become a business of selling and buying gpus and cpus. 
4. HTML, CSS, and Javascript which we have all done in class but I plan to use it to an even further degree and further understand these coding languages while implementing them to my website. 
5. Javascript, java, and python for back end especially for the database as well as SQL. 
6. I considered doing a soccer database and API for professional teams with Ahaan and Antwoine. However, I decided I would rather make this project much more practical and useful for myself as I could possibly reopen my business of creating PCs. I would like to look over what they have done with their soccer database and API and see what I would have done differently or what I can implement to my own website of cpus and gpus. I also considered making a pokemon card price database for rare pokemon cards and a shoe website with API’s for shoe reselling. 

Search CPU
localhost:3999/search/CPU (GET endpoint) -- pass in "author" : "authorName" as a JSON body

Search GPU
localhost:3999/search/GPU (GET endpoint) -- pass in "author" : "authorName" as a JSON body

Search Price
localhost:3999/search/Prices (GET endpoint) -- pass in "author" : "authorName" as a JSON body


OTHER ENDPOINTS (not made) -- For all these customer-specific endpoints, plan is to have user automatically passed as authentication later
